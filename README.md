# Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) for STM32

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and resources necessary to build your own Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) on an STM32 microcontroller. The implementation focuses on core features of an RTOS, demonstrating task scheduling, inter-task communication, and resource management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To deploy this project onto your STM32 microcontroller, you will need:

- An STM32 microcontroller (e.g., STM32F401).
- STM32CubeIDE (available for download from the STMicroelectronics website).
- A USB ST-Link programmer or any compatible programmer for flashing the firmware.

### Cloning the Repository
To clone this repository, open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ypatel789/simpleRTOS.git
